Implementation of Segment Anything Model (SAMv2) by Meta, designed for efficient and versatile image segmentation tasks.

# Segment Anything Model 2 (SAMv2)

A PyTorch implementation of the [Segment Anything Model 2 (SAMv2)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/) by Meta AI. This repository demonstrates how to use the SAMv2 model for advanced image segmentation, including both **point-based** and **bounding box-based** segmentation methods.

---

## Key Features
- **Point-Based Segmentation**: Easily segment objects by clicking on specific points in the image.
- **Bounding Box Segmentation**: Define a region of interest with a bounding box to segment it.
- **High Performance**: Powered by Meta AI’s cutting-edge architecture for image segmentation.
- **Customizable**: Extend the model for various datasets and use cases.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/segment_anything_model2.git
   cd segment_anything_model2
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Verify installation by running the example notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SAMv2.ipynb
   ```

---

## Usage

This repository provides a detailed notebook for running SAMv2 on your images. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Run the Jupyter Notebook
The provided notebook (`SAMv2.ipynb`) includes step-by-step instructions. Open the notebook and follow the guided steps to load and segment your images.

```bash
jupyter notebook SAMv2.ipynb
```

### Step 2: Test With Sample Images
A sample image is already included for testing. Run the provided cells to generate segmentation using **point-based** or **bounding box-based** methods.

### Step 3: Use Your Own Images
To try your own images:
1. Add your images to the `data/` folder.
2. Update the image path in the notebook.
3. Rerun the segmentation cells to see the results.

## Example: Segmentation on a Group Photo

Below is an example of SAMv2 applied to a group photo. The model demonstrates its ability to handle complex scenes effectively using **point-based segmentation** and **bounding boxes**:

In this example:
- **Point-based segmentation** was used to extract specific regions or objects.
- **Bounding boxes** were applied to outline areas of interest before segmentation.

Feel free to replace this example with your own results!
